# MongoDB Introduction

MongoDB is No-SQL Database. That means non-relational database - which provides a mechanism of storage and retrival of data records that are not modeled on tabular relations, as used in traditional relational databases.

## Why No-SQL, reasons:
- Many new applications require to create huge volumes of new, custom data types which are mix of structured, semi-structured, unstructured and polymorphic data.
- Application development has changed from **Waterfall Model** (which takes long production times - typically 12-18 months) to new rapid faster methods like Agile Sprints, iterating quickly and pushing code every week or two.
- Purpose of applications has now changed from being targeted at some fraction of users to Service that has to be always up and running(very less downtime.. virtually none); globally accessible to millions of users.
- Organizations now use more open software technologies, commodity servers and cloud computing instead of large monolithic servers and storage infrastructures.

> Relational databases were not designed to be capable of such scale and agility challanges, nor are built to take advantage of commodity storage and processing power avaialble today.


## MongoDB Features:
__Note: Ref: https://www.mongodb.com/what-is-mongodb__

- MongoDB **stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents**, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time.
- The document model **maps to the objects in your application code**, making data easy to work with.
- **Ad hoc queries, indexing and real time aggregation** provide powerful ways to access and analyze your data.
- MongoDB is a **distributed database at its core**, so high availability, horizontal scaling and geographic distribution are built in and easy to use.
- MongoDB is **free to use**.
