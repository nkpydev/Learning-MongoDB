# MongoDB Introduction

MongoDB is No-SQL Database. That means non-relational database - which provides a mechanism of storage and retrival of data records that are not modeled on tabular relations, as used in traditional relational databases.

> Relational databases lack agility, nor are built to take advantage of commodity storage and processing power avaialble today.

## MongoDB Features:

- MongoDB **stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents**, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time.
- The document model **maps to the objects in your application code**, making data easy to work with.
- **Ad hoc queries, indexing and real time aggregation** provide powerful ways to access and analyze your data.
- MongoDB is a **distributed database at its core**, so high availability, horizontal scaling and geographic distribution are built in and easy to use.
- MongoDB is **free to use**.
